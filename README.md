## crawler-data-service
A simple experiment on persistence/repository/controller generation based on db schema
# Database Platform under usage - Postgres (since i have a schema to use)
This is an early version, the basic idea is generate a workable persistence layer using
jpa and spring to provide an openapi for each table in the schema crawled. 
this version probably will work. still have some hard code ahead but then we are talking about what we love.

Many thanks for those who trust and support me.

Its working for small schemas. on practice databases are exploited and the things will became slow.. we can fix altering schema-crawler to avoid some excessive scan.

Thanks to bytebuddy and schema-crawler the thing works.

its not a "small algorithm" solving a problem.. its all in the "possible small  space".. a solution is a solution... 

I will blame the cognac... but i remembered two things.. 

first is like you are in China by the 15th century...like a guest in some sort "chinese celebration (just like in the movies hum?)"
than that old man  ignate some shit inside a can and that shit thows some colored heave paper all around.. 
every body smiles ... you look to that old man and think ... you are with a "good shit"
the concept of java is the best... 

I will virtualize a machine for you... than you build your own machine... 

in a microsystem if possible...
now if you transform this is a polymorphic machine.. 
than you will learn me.. 

and god is good with me... 
i´m permitted to ignore the news... 

the stamp of my father... the love for the ears.. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zTc2hD2npA
and the good music..
in the practice ... i don´t miss him.. because he teach me to hate the death.. 
the worst enemy.. 
"Just more one falling soldier facing the monster..."
such phrase is reserved just for honest people..
the core of the spirit of the evil... 
i choose the evil because ... our game remains a draw...

The proof the "capitalism"... it's my work.. 
you assume the right of "property"... and with this..
the due of property... for the group ... 
this is important ... the "clan" that claims your property with you.

this is "the savage part"... 
even the poorest communist country in this miserable world must have a bank... 
the insurance companies... "not that much"..

at other side ... the are my friends... its a desonorable shit indeed... 
the face of the truth.. "where is the polymorphism?"
join the movie with the music can be considered a "crime"?
the size the "word"... in on your shoulders...

it's just remember that he cames alive in me... 
he had some belief.

Being honest does not have a price.. and your dues does not judge you... 
just say. you have dues..
and if you walk "with a lot a sins".. and they dont stop to grow.. 

you are blessed. 

friends and after all

the practice... one thing very very very important.. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xdS-9zOUZQ

need to a "sunner" to understand this..

the "language" is not important ...i agree... 

important is the practice.. practice always point to the future.

JVM is a "problem solved"

dont came being a burglar reinventing the wheel.. 

the principle of computing is "the right thing will born from inside.. dont worry"

that is the "thing" the smallest of the righteous...
