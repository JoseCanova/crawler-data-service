## crawler-data-service
A simple experiment on persistence/repository/controller generation based on db schema
# Database Platform under usage - Postgres (since i have a schema to use)
This is an early version, the basic idea is generate a workable persistence layer using
jpa and spring to provide an openapi for each table in the schema crawled. 
this version probably will work. still have some hard code ahead but then we are talking about what we love.

Many thanks for those who trust and support me.

Its working for small schemas. on practice databases are exploited and the things will became slow.. we can fix altering schema-crawler to avoid some excessive scan.

Thanks to bytebuddy and schema-crawler the thing works.

its not a "small algorithm" solving a problem.. its all in the "possible small  space".. a solution is a solution... 

I will blame the cognac... but i remembered two things.. 

first is like you are in China by the 15th century...like a guest in some sort "chinese celebration (just like in the movies hum?)"
than that old man  ignate some shit inside a can and that shit thows some colored heave paper all around.. 
every body smiles ... you look to that old man and think ... you are with a "good shit"
the concept of java is the best... 

I will virtualize a machine for you... than you build your own machine... 

in a microsystem if possible...
now if you transform this is a polymorphic machine.. 
than you will learn me.. 

and god is good with me... 
i´m permitted to ignore the news... 

the stamp of my father... the love for the ears.. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zTc2hD2npA
and the good music..
in the practice ... i don´t miss him.. because he teach me to hate the death.. 
the worst enemy.. 
"Just more one falling soldier facing the monster..."
such phrase is reserved just for honest people..
the core of the spirit of the evil... 
i choose the evil because ... our game remains a draw...

The proof the "capitalism"... it's my work.. 
you assume the right of "property"... and with this..
the due of property... for the group ... 
this is important ... the "clan" that claims your property with you.

this is "the savage part"... 
even the poorest communist country in this miserable world must have a bank... 
the insurance companies... "not that much".. 

59 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoaFxvtpd-E&t=231s

at other side ... the are my friends... its a desonorable shit indeed... 
the face of the truth.. "where is the polymorphism?"
join the movie with the music can be considered a "crime"?
the size the "word"... in on your shoulders...

it's just remember that he cames alive in me... 
he had some belief.

Being honest does not have a price.. and your dues does not judge you... 
just say. you have dues..
and if you walk "with a lot a sins".. and they dont stop to grow.. 

you are blessed. 

friends and after all 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkvd7pbfM78

the practice... one thing very very very important.. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xdS-9zOUZQ

need to a "sunner" to understand this..

the "language" is not important ...i agree... 

important is the practice.. practice always point to the future.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xdS-9zOUZQ

JVM is a "problem solved"

dont came being a burglar reinventing the wheel.. 

the principle of computing is "the right thing will born from inside.. dont worry"

that is the "thing" the smallest of the righteous... 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZH2it92ZmA

what the programmer need is a machine that represents a machine...

being honest its also have to right to say.. 

if not worked.. fuck your self ... i fuck mine.. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDAYg196x8

even the worst shit responds.. :-)

its like when i ask ... you dont "all the mathemathics" behing ORM?

do you think that "is a matter of hibernate"?

all that new math that appears every day...

how high.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45cYwDMibGo

"Ah ok... you've learn ... the core math.. hum?"... 


Im abstracting a little bit more... thing more than twice... .. but ... 

the "impedance on practice is a little bit far because its the paradigm"

if its solved for one..

"im against this mathematical formulation called ORM"... ;-)

more one subtraction lover.. 

"it's a luxury after all Oracle have bought or prepared all right"

heart barracuda is family...

what we call "impedance mismatch" that sounds very grave... they 
call a luxury of java programmers... 

just more one stupid bitch that dont know the gravity of immutability... bitch..

and solve this problem is great... in matter of fact "BIG"... 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDG2m5hN1vo&list=RDGMEMJQXQAmqrnmK1SEjY_rKBGA&start_radio=1&rv=PeMvMNpvB5M

all the math artifact to work in proof not in the theory.. was given..

materialize an entity.. is "something really serious"...

remembering both now.. "jezz"... 

they studied to leave a message for the clan... 

quite primitive indeed... :-) 

one software engineering "impedance mismatch means"

at each part that i bring your world to my world... 

"i create a possible origin of problem".

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzHui4ybChU

few conventions ... and a lot of "sort of geniality"

can be the impossible of the complicated.. 

but need to walk under the premise.. 

the best of the smallest.. 

your hands will be on the plate.

i few so sorry more one fucking that is a totally ignorant behind the math of ORM... 

he thinks that we are "hibernaters..." and not a kind of stuff trying to minimize a problem. the why https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6F2753tpLQ

listening this..i know who started the fight.. us like usual.. look the phrase.. 

lool my friend you hero ...its like a good .. but thruth has a logic... 

 there is no "thruth 2.0" and we know that . 
 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6F2753tpLQ
  
  this is how the problems begins... 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G6NtIVZhRE

fix taxonomies... literaly.. otherwise you drop in the euclid´s problem.
the best for the smallest... 

the COOD object Paradigm after all "object are mutations"... and records need a timespamp..there is no record without time.

lets think about ... "immutable"... with relation of what?
]
if you are immutable... that best that i call you ... something close of noting.. https://youtu.be/ORnvO1VyYMk

a memory... something that to gain some meaning.. will be thrown to the 0´s and 1´s but with a time at side.. 

being realistic... must use the "class" metamodel... os persistence jpa.

by the end the name strategy that is used on the columns to generate the schema is wrong. (for the legacy keys.)

name strategy is quite bugged... almost being compeled to do the things at the right manner.. 

but let go a little bit far... conventionate the payload transfer since is a "context payload"..

that object serialize it's properties also like class+property.
