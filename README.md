## crawler-data-service
A simple experiment on persistence/repository/controller generation based on db schema
# Database Platform under usage - Postgres (since i have a schema to use)
This is an early version, the basic idea is generate a workable persistence layer using
jpa and spring to provide an openapi for each table in the schema crawled. 
this version probably will work. still have some hard code ahead the we are talking about what we love.

The application required a simple eureka server to work with eureka client. this is not required but im using to look on spring cloud. so feel free to remove the code of interest.

Many thanks for those who trust and support me.

- version 0.0.1-snapshot.
